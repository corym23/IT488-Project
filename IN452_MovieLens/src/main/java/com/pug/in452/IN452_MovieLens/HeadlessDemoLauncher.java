/**
 * HeadlessDemoLauncher (DEPRECATED)
 *
 * This class previously provided a headless console-based demo runner that
 * started the simulator without the GUI. The headless demo has been removed
 * from normal execution and this class now serves as a harmless stub to
 * prevent accidental headless runs. It remains in the source tree for
 * historical/reference purposes.
 *
 * Notes for maintainers:
 * - If you want to re-enable a headless demo, implement a main method that
 *   constructs a DemoMovieLensDB, creates a MovieLensSimulator, sets the
 *   simulation speed, and starts the simulator. Ensure any long-running
 *   threads are managed so the process exits cleanly.
 * - This class is marked @Deprecated to indicate it should not be used in
 *   new code.
