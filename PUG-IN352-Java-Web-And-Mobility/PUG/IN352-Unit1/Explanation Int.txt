This Java class, `IN352_McCombs_Cory_Unit1_Assignment`, demonstrates the use of recursion to solve two classic problems: calculating Fibonacci numbers and computing factorials. The class is structured for an academic assignment, with clear sections and comments guiding the implementation.

At the top, a static integer array `fibMemo` is declared for memoization, which helps optimize the recursive Fibonacci calculation by storing previously computed results. This prevents redundant calculations and significantly improves performance for larger input values.

In the `main` method, the program first prints a blank line, then calculates the 10th Fibonacci number by calling the `Fibonacci` method with the argument `10`. The result is printed in a descriptive format. The `Fibonacci` method itself uses recursion and memoization: it checks for base cases (0 and 1), throws an exception for negative input, and otherwise recursively computes the value while storing results in the `fibMemo` array.

The second section of the `main` method prints another blank line and then uses a loop to calculate and print the factorials of numbers 1 through 4. The `factorial` method is a straightforward recursive implementation: it returns 1 for the base cases (0 or 1), and otherwise multiplies the current number by the factorial of the previous number.

Overall, this code provides clear examples of recursion, base cases, and memoization, making it a strong educational resource for understanding these fundamental programming concepts.
