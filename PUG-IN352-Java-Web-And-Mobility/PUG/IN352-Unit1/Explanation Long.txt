This Java class, `IN352_McCombs_Cory_Unit1_Assignment_Long`, demonstrates recursive programming techniques to solve two classic mathematical problems: calculating Fibonacci numbers and computing factorials. The class is structured for an academic assignment and includes clear comments to guide the reader through each section.

The class begins by declaring a static array, `fibMemo`, which is used for memoization in the Fibonacci calculation. Memoization is a technique that stores previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations, significantly improving the efficiency of recursive algorithms, especially for problems like Fibonacci where many subproblems overlap.

In the `main` method, the program first prints a blank line, then calculates the 92nd Fibonacci number by calling the `Fibonacci` method. The number 92 is chosen because it is the largest Fibonacci number that can fit within a Java `long` data type without causing overflow. The result is printed to the console in a descriptive format.

The second section of the `main` method prints another blank line and then uses a loop to calculate and print the factorials of the numbers 1 through 4. The results are displayed in the standard mathematical notation (e.g., `4! = 24`).

The `Fibonacci` method itself is a recursive function that handles base cases for 0 and 1, throws an exception for negative input, and otherwise computes the Fibonacci value by summing the results of the two preceding numbers. It uses the `fibMemo` array to store and retrieve previously computed values, which prevents unnecessary repeated calculations.

The `factorial` method is a straightforward recursive implementation. It returns 1 for the base cases of 0 or 1, and for other values, it multiplies the current number by the factorial of the previous number.

Overall, this code provides clear and practical examples of recursion, base cases, and memoization, making it a useful resource for learning these fundamental programming concepts.
